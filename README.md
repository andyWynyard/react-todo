# react-todo

## Simple react application to make a grocery list. Has the CR*D (no update) functions.

### To recreate:
1. Clone
2. run: npm install
3. Should have installed all that is necessary
4. run: npm start
5. Playtime

NOTE: All of the node_modules are here, so the npm install might not be needed. The program is only 14MiB, so all good.

Shouldn't be any issues, have a play.
